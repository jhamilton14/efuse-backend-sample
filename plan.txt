1. create docker environment - connect with mongodb
	need to spin up redis. mongodb, express
2. figure out redis - add it to the docker environment
3. set up express server
4. create simple http requests

make sure to have error checks if certain things don't exist in redis or db (may not be necessary)

If I had more time:
-add error checking to make sure data is in redis prior to pulling then pull from mongodb as a backup -> can maybe implement this
